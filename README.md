# markdeep-slides

Build presentation slides with Markdeep and present them right in your browser.


## Features

* TODO draft and presentation view, keyboard shortcuts, presenter notes, printing to pdf, autoplaying videos
* TODO you can style your slides using CSS. This is the biggest advantage to me, personally – LaTeX is great and all, but things can get tricky. And let's not talk about PowerPoint and its various knockoffs.
* TODO everything else markdeep has to offer, diagrams
* TODO compatible with presenters – if yours doesn't work, go to https://keycode.info and record which keycodes each button sends, what happened, what you expected to happen and file an issue accordingly.


## Demo

TODO link to it http://doersino.github.io/markdeep-slides/slides.md.html#slide16


## Setup & Usage

It's best to download a release, since that comes pre-loaded with a working combination of Markdeep, MathJax, the webfonts used by the predefined themes, and more – it'll work offline (unless you include YouTube videos or something in your slides). You can't rely on wifi being available when and where you'll present – that's just asking for trouble.

Alternatively, checkout the `release` branch.

But if you just want to take a look at how this thing works:

```
$ git clone TODO
```

And then open `slides.md.html` in your text editor and browser of choice. TODO

TODO highlight some markdeep features? dividing slides using `---` etc.
