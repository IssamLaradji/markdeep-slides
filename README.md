# markdeep-slides

*Build presentation slides with Markdeep and present them right in your browser.*

<img align="right" width="400" src="screenshot.jpg">

* Two modes:
    * **Draft** â€“ with inline presenter notes, useful as a preview when building slides.
    * **Presentation** (shown right) â€“ full-screen, with your *presenter notes in a separate window*.
    * You can also **generate a PDF version** of your slides.
* **Keyboard shortcuts** for all relevant functions.
* Supports **everything Markdeep has to offer** â€“ diagrams, math, inline videos, citations, admonitions, and all the standard Markdown stuff.
* If you don't like any of the predefined themes: **Style your slides with CSS!** LaTeX and Beamer are great, but things can get tricky. And *let's not talk about PowerPoint* and its various knockoffs.
* The full power of CSS animations and JavaScript is at your fingertips â€“ use it wisely.
* **3 built-in themes** â€“ but you can also make your own with a couple dozen lines of CSS.
* Compatible with those little [presenter gadgets](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Presenter-Presentation-Pointer/dp/B00B6MODOA/).


#### **Demo:** Try it out [right here on GitHub Pages](https://doersino.github.io/markdeep-slides/demo.md.html)!


## Getting started

### Setup

This repository contains **copies of all dependencies** (Markdeep, MathJax and the webfonts used by the built-in themes) by design â€“ it'll **work offline** (unless you include YouTube videos or something in your slides). *You don't want to rely on wifi being available when and where you'll present â€“ that's just asking for trouble.*

####  Clone this repository or [download a ZIP](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/archive/master.zip). [ðŸ“¦](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/archive/master.zip)

Then, navigate to `demo.md.html` and open it in your text editor and browser of choice â€“ that's it. *Happy slide building!*


### Options

At the bottom of `demo.md.html`, right before the essential JavaScript files are loaded, you'll find a set of options:

```html
<script>
markdeepSlidesOptions = {
    aspectRatio: 16 / 9,  // aspect ratio of your slides
    theme: 'simple',      // theme â€“ "simple", "serif" or "deepsea"
    fontSize: 28,         // base font size
    diagramZoom: 1.0      // markdeep diagram scaling factor
};
</script>
```

Modify them to your liking, but don't decrease the font size too much (nobody wants to read novel-length slides). Additionally, you can tweak some aspects of each theme by overriding CSS variables â€“ take a look at the relevant CSS file in `markdeep-slides/themes/`.


## Contributing

Got an idea on how to improve something? Ran into unexpected behavior? Found a bug? (Maybe even fixed that bug?)

*Please [file an issue](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/issues) or send a pull request! I'll be happy to take a look at it.*

### Notes

* **Tested** in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I don't have access to Edge/IE, so you're on your own there (although I suspect the folks interested in writing their slides in Markdeep aren't using these browsers anyway). Not really made for mobile use.
* The included variant of **MathJax** has been [heavily stripped down](https://github.com/mathjax/MathJax-docs/wiki/Guide:-reducing-size-of-a-mathjax-installation/1814429ed1e97bfb7675c0fd400804baa9287249) and only allows SVG as the output format. This was done to keep the size to a minimum and because SVG output looks best (other formats may be more accessible, but that doesn't matter in a presentation context).
* If your **presenter** gadget doesn't work, please go to https://keycode.info and record *1. which keycodes each button sends, 2. what happened, 3. what you expected to happen* and file an issue accordingly.


#### Making your own theme

* If you're making your own themes, make sure that all `font-size`s, `margin`s, `padding`s, `width`s, `height`s and other sizes are **defined in terms of `rem` `em` or `%`**. This enables your elements to scale properly depending on screen size. So don't use `px`, `pt`, or `mm`.
* Also don't use `vw` and `vh` as size units â€“ depending on the aspect ratio of your display and your slides, your **slides will be [letterboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming))**, so `100vh` might be larger than the width of your slides (the same goes for height). The actual slide width and height can be read from the CSS variables `var(--slide-width)` and `var(--slide-height)`, respectively.
* Use CSS `var`iables to keep your theme configurable (take a look at the existing themes to see some examples).
* Keep in mind that the presenter notes will inherit your theme's styles.
* **Download any webfonts to your computer.** Again, *you don't want to rely on wifi being available when and where you'll present*. To download webfonts from Google Fonts, I recommend using [this tool](https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts).


### Known issues

If you know of an elegant way of fixing these, I'd very much appreciate a heads up.

* When resizing the window in Safari in draft mode, the font size is not scaled accordingly. No idea why â€“ it's defined in terms of `vw` units in CSS, so it *should* scale as the viewport width changes.
* When leaving fullscreen mode in Firefox using <kbd>Esc</kbd>, presentation mode sometimes persists. No idea why â€“ leaving it by pressing <kbd>f</kbd> fires the same event, so the same stuff *should* happen.
* After refreshing while in fullscreen mode in Safari, the only way to exit fullscreen mode is clicking the green button â€“ and even after that, presentation mode persists because the `webkitfullscreenchange` event does not fire in this situation. (Other browsers exit fullscreen mode upon refresh, making this a non-issue there.)
