TODO hero image thingy?

*Build presentation slides with Markdeep and present them right in your browser.*

* Two modes: **Draft** (with inline presenter notes) and **presentation** (full-screen, with *presenter notes in a separate window*). You can also **generate a PDF** of your slides!
* **Keyboard shortcuts** for all relevant functions.
* Supports **everything Markdeep has to offer** â€“ diagrams, math, inline videos, citations, admonitions, and all the standard Markdown stuff.
* If you don't like any of the predefined themes: **Style your slides with CSS!** LaTeX Beamer is great, but things can get tricky. And *let's not talk about PowerPoint* and its various knockoffs.
* The full power of CSS animations and JavaScript is at your fingertips â€“ use it wisely.
* 3 built-in themes â€“ but you can make your own with a couple dozen lines of CSS.
* Compatible with those little [presenter gadgets](https://www.amazon.com/Logitech-Wireless-Presenter-Presentation-Pointer/dp/B00B6MODOA/).

#### **Demo:** Try it out [right here on GitHub Pages](https://doersino.github.io/markdeep-slides/slides.md.html)!


## Setup & Usage

It's best to **download a release**, since that comes **prepackaged with a well-tested combination of Markdeep, MathJax**, the webfonts used by the built-in themes, and more â€“ it'll **work offline** (unless you include YouTube videos or something in your slides). *You don't want to rely on wifi being available when and where you'll present â€“ that's just asking for trouble.*

#### The most recent releases are [available here](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/releases). [ðŸ“¦](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/releases)

Alternatively, you can `git clone` this repository and then `git checkout` the `release` branch.

But if you just want to take a quick look at how this thing works on your own machine, go ahead and `git clone` the hell out of this repository. Then, open `slides.md.html` in your text editor and browser of choice. Again, if you decide to use this thing for an actualy presentation, grab a release so you're unaffected by the whims of the WiFi gods.


## Contributing

*Please [file an issue](https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides/issues) or send a pull request! I'll be happy to take a look at it.*

### Notes & Implementation details

* Tested in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox and Safari. I don't have access to Edge/IE, so you're on your own there (although I suspect the folks interested in writing their slides in Markdeep aren't using these browsers anyway). Not really made for mobile use.
* If you're making your own themes, only use relative sizes: `em`, `rem`, `%`. This allows the slides to scale arbitrarily. So don't use `px`, `pt`, `mm` etc. Also don't use `vw` and `vh` â€“ depending on the aspect ratio of your display and your slides, your slides will be [letterboxed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letterboxing_(filming)), so `100vh` might be larger than the width of your slides (the same goes for height).
* If your presenter gadget doesn't work, please go to https://keycode.info and record which keycodes each button sends, what happened, what you expected to happen and file an issue accordingly.
* TODO more
