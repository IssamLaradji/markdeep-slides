# Quick start

---

## Setup

1. Clone this repository.

    ```php
    $ git clone https://github.com/doersino/markdeep-slides
    ```

2. Replace the contents of this file with your slide contents ‚Äì keep the first line and the final lines intact; they're where the magic happens!

---

## Formatting

Use **horizontal lines to begin a new slide**:

```
slide 1
---
slide 2
---
slide 3
```

If you want to use a horizontal line *on* one of your slides, write `<hr class="ignore">`.

<hr class="ignore">

See? üíØ

## Shortcuts

Press...

* <kbd>space</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üì</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üí</kbd> or <kbd>PgDn</kbd> to go to the next slide,
* <kbd>‚Üë</kbd>, <kbd>‚Üê</kbd> or <kbd>PgUp</kbd> to go to the next slide,
* <kbd>F</kbd>, <kbd>F5</kbd> or <kbd>Esc</kbd> to enter or exit fullscreen presentation mode and
* <kbd>.</kbd> to turn the screen black (and back again).
* <kbd>n</kbd> to open a window with your presenter notes (more on the next slide).

These little presenter clicker thingies should work no problem.

>>> Presenter notes
>>>
>>> * look like this...
>>> * or this.
>>>
>>> Your can use *arbitrary* Markdeep stuff in here!

## Presenter notes

Press <kbd>n</kbd> to open a **window with the presenter notes** and a basic clock. They will update as you move between slides. All **shortcuts work** even when the presenter notes window is focused.

Presenter notes **support Markdeep** and can be **defined using three nested blockquotes**, like so:

```markdown
>>> Don't just read what's *on* the slides out loud, ya loon.
>>> Here's some additional information:
>>> * Cats are cute.
```

In draft mode, presenter notes are shown below each slide.

---

## Printing to PDF

You can **export a PDF version** of your slides by simply **printing it to a PDF file** using your browser's built-in tools ‚Äì in my experience, this **works best in Chrome** as  it respect the `@page` CSS selector properly.

In the print modal, set "Margins" to "None" and make sure to keep the "Background graphics" option enabled.

## Options

There are TODO options:

* `aspectRatio` defines the aspect ratio of your slides.

```
<script>
markdeepSlidesOptions = {
    aspectRatio: 16 / 9
};
</script>
```

Make sure to define your options *before* loading Markdeep.

## Tips

I recommend using only local resources (images, fonts, a local copy of mathjax) unless you're absolutely sure you'll have internet connectivity where you'll be holding your presentation.

* To download fonts from Google fonts, use https://google-webfonts-helper.herokuapp.com/fonts.
* A guide on running MathJax locally can be found at http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/installation.html. Note that you'll have to add `detectMath: false` to your Markdeep config then. This has the added benefit of being able to configure MathJax to your liking.

---

## Themeing

If your want to make your own theme, here are some helpful tips:

* Make sure that all font sizes, margins, paddings, widths and heights are defined in terms of `rem` or `em`.
* This enables your elements to scale properly depending on screen size.

## Terminology

When going fullscreen, you switch from **draft mode** into **presentation mode**.

---

## Known issues

* When resizing the window in Safari in draft mode, the font size is not scaled accordingly. No idea why ‚Äì it's defined in terms of `vw` units in CSS, so it *should* scale as viewport width changes. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* Switching slides in Chrome using the arrow keys in draft mode sometimes skips over slides or requires two presses to get to the next slide. Scrolling works fine, the arrow keys work fine in presentation mode, and it works fine in other browsers. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
* When leaving fullscreen mode in Firefox using <kbd>Esc</kbd>, presentation mode sometimes persists. No idea why ‚Äì leaving it through <kbd>f</kbd> fires the same event, so the same stuff *should* happen. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

---

* After refreshing while in fullscreen in Safari, the only way to exit fullscreen mode is clicking the green button ‚Äì and even after that, presentation mode persists because the `webkitfullscreenchange` event does not fire in this situation. Other browsers exit fullscreen mode upon refresh, making this a non-issue there. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

TL;DR: Every browser is its own flavor of terrible.

MathJax:

$$
{\hat O_p} = \frac 1 {C_p} \sum_{{q \in \mathcal N_p}} {w(p, q)} {O_q}
$$
